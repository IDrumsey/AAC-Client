ISSUES - 

    left side nav bar - each btn has margin under it. Can't get the :not(:last-child) selector to work to remove the margin from the last btn since it doesn't need it.

    cache is being updated ALOT. should take a look at it at some point. See 'I-1'

    notification delete animation not running. See I-2

    getTime() being called several times. binded to value attribute. See I-3

    caching might not be accounting for the endpoint http verbs being used leading to not getting the up to date data from server because app gets it from cache accidentally

    strobing might happen on slower systems when the two hover events conflict - See I-4

    screen flicker on /centers/1 when loading data from cache

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT - 

    image preview delete single image from selection - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53536826/angular-how-to-add-remove-files-in-the-angular

    server side - check if an image already exists to not waste memory

    notification click to continue required. See F-1

    delete changes confirmation on logout during store detail changes. See F-2

    Require both open and close times when adding store times. See F-3

    See animals center details dynamic routing

    animal info form location default to currently selected animal
